        "Lesson: Even though you bust, it was still the right play. Long-term odds favor hitting on 12 vs 2", // scenario one done
        "Tip: The dealer has a 6, which is a bust card, but is a strong bust card (3-6). The dealer is likely to bust, so you should stand if you are over 11",
        "Lesson: When the dealer shows 3-6 and you have greater than 11, you don't risk your own hand and know they have to hit and hope they bust", // scenario 2 done
        "Tip: With 2 aces, both are likely to give you 2 strong hands if you split. Basic strategy is to always split aces",
        "Lesson: One hand became 19, the other 18. Both became good hands instead of one bad 12 hand", // scenario 3 done
        "Tip: You already have a strong 20 hand, splitting risks turning a strong hand into 2 weaker ones. Dealer has a strong bust card (6) anyways. Strategy says to stand",
        "Lesson: Don't mess with a great hand, especially when a dealer is likely to bust. Never split 10's", // scenario 4 done
        "Tip: 11 is the best hand to double on. Most cards will get you close to or at 21",
        "Lesson: Always double on 11", // scenario 5 done
        "Tip: Soft 18 isn't great vs a dealer 9 or 10. Doubling only gets you one card and you might be stuck at a worse position. Strategy is to hit if the dealer's card is greater than yours and over 7 as long as you are under 17",
        "Tip: You now have 21, always stand",
        "Lesson: Don't overcommit against strong dealer upcard", // scenario 6 done
        "Lesson: Sometimes there's no escaping a loss. Unfortunetly, that's part of the game", // scenario 7 done
        "Tip: Soft 17 is a weak hand, treat it more like 7 than 17. Since the dealer has a 9, strategy says to hit",
        "Tip: 19 is a strong hand, strategy says to now stand",
        "Lesson: Keep hitting soft 17 until you reach over the dealer's card with a 10 (19) or until hard 17", // scenario 8 done
        "Tip: Any 8's should be split, hard 16 is the worst possible hand since it is still considered a weak hand but closest to busting. Two chances at 18+ beats one guarenteed 16",
        "Tip: While normally doubling on 11, you cannot double after splitting. Strategy says to hit since no change at busting",
        "Tip: you now have 21, always stand",
        "Tip: Strategy says to hit on a 10.",
        "Tip: You never hit once at or above hard 17, strategy is to stand",
        "Lesson: First hand reaches 21 and wins, while the other reaches 18 pushes the dealer's 18. ALways split 8's, turns a horrible 17 into 2 possibly good hands", // scenario 9
        "Tip: A hard 18 is strong vs a dealer 7. The dealer is not allowed to hit once he reaches 17. Basic strategy is to stand on a pair of 9's against a 7 (only split when the dealer has 2-6, and 8-9)",
        "Lesson: Know when not to split. Nine pairs are an exception to the 'always split pairs'", // scenario 10 done
        "Tip: Soft 18 vs a weak dealer card (2-6) is a prime doubling spot. You can't bust and you'll often end up around 20",
        "Lesson: Don't treat soft 18 or soft 17 like a regular 18/17 vs a dealer 2-6, it's a double opportunity", // scenario 11 done
        "Tip: The dealer has a 7, which is a strong face up card. You as the player should always hit until you reach 17 if the dealer has a strong card",
        "Tip: You reached 21! Always stand once at or above hard 17",
        "Lesson: Never stand on a 16 vs a dealer 7 or higher. Take the risk to reduce the dealer's advantage", // scenario 12 done
        "Tip: You should always stand on any hard 17 or higher. Hitting a 17 has too high of a chance to bust, and one hit won't guarentee beeing the dealer's 10",
        "Lesson: Hard 17 is a 'stand no exception' hand, even vs a dealer 10. You still managed to push which is a wash of a round", // scenario 13 done
